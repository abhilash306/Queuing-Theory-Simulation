# Problem 1
Generate Poisson distributed random packet arrival process with arrival rate λ= 
5 packets per second from the first principles (i.e., using basic uniformly 
distributed RAND function between 0and 1). Find the distribution (pdf) of 
packet inter-arrival times and plot it.
# Problem 2
Consider an M/M/1 queueing system with arrival rate λ= 5 packets per second 
and service rate μ= 7 packets per second. 
(a) Plot the probability of n packets in the system, where n varies from 0 to ∞. 
(b) Repeat the exercise in (a), with μ= 4 packets per second, and comment on 
the two results.
